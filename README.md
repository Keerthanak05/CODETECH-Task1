![Screenshot 2024-12-01 121617](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73b5f92d-2d9d-4cda-9e98-69f952e9e5f0)


1. Objectives
 
Primary Objective:

Develop an application that generates realistic and contextually relevant images from textual descriptions.

2. Key Activities

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Collect paired datasets of text descriptions and corresponding images (e.g., COCO, Oxford-102 Flowers).
Preprocess text (tokenization, embedding) and images (normalization, resizing).
Model Selection and Training:

Choose an appropriate model (e.g., GANs, Diffusion Models, or AttnGAN).
Train the model on text-image datasets with supervised learning techniques.
Application Development:

Build a user interface for text input and image display.
Implement backend logic to process text, run the model, and render images.
Testing and Evaluation:

Evaluate the quality of generated images using metrics like FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) and human feedback.
Debug issues in generation (e.g., irrelevant outputs, poor image quality).
Optimization and Deployment:

Optimize model inference for speed and scalability.
Deploy the application on a platform (e.g., web app, mobile app).
